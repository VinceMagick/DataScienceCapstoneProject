### Data Exploration

To complete Project 1, I performed the following steps using Python:

#### 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration: 
Load the dataset and perform a descriptive analysis to understand the variables and their values.

#### 2. Handling Missing Values: 
Identify and treat missing values in the specified columns (Glucose, blood pressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI).

#### 3. Visual Exploration:
* Create histograms for the specified variables to visually explore their distributions.
* Create a count plot to describe the data types and the count of variables.

#### 4. Data Balance Check: 
Plot the count of outcomes to check the balance of the data and describe the findings.

#### 5. Scatter Plots: Create scatter charts between pairs of variables to understand relationships and describe the findings.

#### 6. Correlation Analysis: Perform correlation analysis and visualize it using a heat map.
