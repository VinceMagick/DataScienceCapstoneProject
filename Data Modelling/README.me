To complete Project 2, I will follow these steps:

### Data Modelling:

1. Model Building Strategy:
* Validation Framework: I will use a train-test split to evaluate the model's performance. Typically, 70% of the data is used for training, and 30% for testing. Additionally, I will use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and to avoid overfitting.
* Feature Selection: I will consider all available features initially and may perform feature selection based on their importance or correlation with the target variable.

2. Classification Algorithm:
* I will apply a classification algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest to build the model. I will also use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for comparison.

3. Model Comparison:
* I will compare the performance of various models, including KNN, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. Classification Report:
* I will generate a classification report that includes sensitivity (recall), specificity, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.
